# hello-world
G's first repository
Hi dear people in the world. This is my first meeting with Github. I've started the course Back-end development at Winc Academy located in Amsterdam. I'm very new to this all, so I can use all the help I can get from you guys. If you read this don't hesitate to send me a message, I'd love to meet you. Bye for now. See you later.
